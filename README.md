# News Sentiment and Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying news articles based on sentiment using machine learning techniques. It aims to automatically categorize news content (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) and organize it into predefined categories. The approach leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze text data and machine learning models for sentiment detection and classification.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses Hugging face pretrained model and hypertune model to predict the sentiment of each news article.
- **News Classification**: Classifies articles into categories such as Politics, Sports, Technology, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implements performance metrics to assess the accuracy and efficiency of classification.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

This project aims to provide a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis and categorization of news articles, which can be useful for applications in journalism, finance, and public opinion analysis.
